| exa: a compiler for a very small subset of scheme, namely `let` expressions and addition.
|
+----------------+

I am just doing this project out of curiosity. I want to know how it is like to build a compiler in Python; so far, I am having fun programming this. Thanks
It compiles `let` expressions and `primitives` to a series of assembly instructions via the `select-instructions` pass.
Note: so far the compiler generates mostly correct instructions except for the registers -- it uses the variables as registers.

This is an experiement to see how I would build a more substantial compiler in Python3. Just trying things out.

To create the ast you need to call `parse_tree_to_ast(parser.parse("(let ((n 3))  (+ n n))")

ast --> uniquify --> remove-complex -> explicate-control --> instruction selection

Thanks to all the professors and programmers who have written compiler textbooks and compiler tools.
